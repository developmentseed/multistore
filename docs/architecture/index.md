# Architecture Overview

Multistore is an S3-compliant gateway that sits between clients and backend object stores. It provides authentication, authorization, and transparent proxying with zero-copy streaming.

## Design Principles

**Runtime-agnostic core** — The core proxy logic (`multistore`) has zero runtime dependencies. No Tokio, no `worker-rs`. It compiles to both native and WASM targets.

**Path-based router** — A `Router` maps URL paths to `RouteHandler` implementations using `matchit` for efficient matching. Extension crates provide `Router` extension traits (e.g., `OidcRouterExt`, `StsRouterExt`) for one-call registration, keeping protocol-specific logic out of runtimes.

**Two-phase dispatch** — The `ProxyGateway` separates request resolution from execution. `resolve_request()` determines what to do; the runtime executes it. This keeps streaming logic in runtime-specific code where it belongs.

**Presigned URLs for streaming** — GET, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE operations use presigned URLs. The runtime forwards the request directly to the backend — no buffering, no double-handling of bodies.

**Pluggable traits** — Four trait boundaries enable customization:
- `Router` / `RouteHandler` — Path-based pre-dispatch request interception (STS, OIDC discovery, custom endpoints)
- `BucketRegistry` — Bucket lookup, authorization, and listing
- `CredentialRegistry` — Credential and role storage
- `ProxyBackend` — How the runtime interacts with backends

## Key Components

| Component | Crate | Responsibility |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| [ProxyGateway](./request-lifecycle) | `multistore` | Router-based dispatch + S3 parsing + identity resolution + two-phase dispatch |
| [BucketRegistry](./request-lifecycle#request-resolution) | `multistore` | Bucket lookup, authorization, listing |
| [CredentialRegistry](/configuration/providers/) | `multistore` | Load credentials and roles |
| [STS Route Handler](/auth/proxy-auth#oidcsts-temporary-credentials) | `multistore-sts` | OIDC token exchange, credential minting |
| [OIDC Provider](/auth/backend-auth#oidc-backend-auth) | `multistore-oidc-provider` | Self-signed JWT minting, OIDC discovery, backend credential exchange |
| [Server Runtime](./multi-runtime#server-runtime) | `multistore-server` | Tokio/Hyper HTTP server |
| [Workers Runtime](./multi-runtime#cloudflare-workers-runtime) | `multistore-cf-workers` | WASM-based Cloudflare Workers |
